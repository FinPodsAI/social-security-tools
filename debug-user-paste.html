<h1>User Paste Debug Feedback Tool</h1>

<p>
If you are viewing this, you were probably sent here by the author of this site
because your browser is pasting data into ssa.gov in a way that breaks the
parsing functionality built into the site.
</p>

<p>
For privacy reasons, none of the data entered into this site is ever stored or
sent to the site. It remains on your own computer. As a result, it is difficult
for me to learn more about why the data input sometimes fails users, because
I don't have a failing input to test with. That's why you are here. If you are
willing, you can send me the formatting your browser users for copy/pasting
data without sending me the actual dollar numbers. This will be helpful for me
to improve the website tool for you and other users.

</p>
<p>
This page allows you to paste your ssa.gov data into a text box, and the page
will process it in two steps:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>It will replace all numerical characters with <code>0</code>s.
      So "<code>1999 $12,500</code>" will become "<code>0000 $00,000</code>".
      This is to protect your privacy.</li>
  <li>It will <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">encode</a> the
      zeroed out data, so that spaces, tabs, and newlines won't be modified
      by your email provider.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
This tool will not send any data to me. If you feel comfortable with it's
output, you can then send the final encoded zeroed out data to me privately
in an email for testing.
</p>

<script>
function zerodata() {
  let pasteEl = document.getElementById('paste');
  let value = pasteEl.value;
  value = value.replace(/[0-9]/g, "0");
  let zeroEl = document.getElementById('zero');
  zeroEl.value = value;
  b64data();
}
function b64data() {
  let zeroEl = document.getElementById('zero');
  let value = zeroEl.value;
  value = btoa(value);
  out = "-----BEGIN PASTE DATA-----\n"
  for (var i = 0; i < value.length; i += 64) {
    out += value.substr(i, 64) + '\n';
  }
  out += "-----END PASTE DATA-----\n"
  
  let base64El = document.getElementById('base64');
  base64El.value = out;
}
function copyText() {
  let base64El = document.getElementById('base64');
  base64El.select();
  document.execCommand("copy");
  alert("'Copied the text:\n" + base64El.value);
}

</script>

<h3>Step 1: Paste your "Earnings Record" into the box below, exactly as from ssa.gov:</h3>
<textarea id=paste oninput="zerodata()"></textarea>

<h3>Step 2: Inspect the zeroed out copy below:</h3>
<p>
Delete any data you feel shouldn't be shared with me such as your name, but
try not to modify the formatting (number of lines, extra spaces between the
lines, commas, etc).
</p>
<textarea id=zero oninput="b64data()"></textarea>

<h3>Step 3: Copy the contents of this box and email to me.</h3>
<textarea id=base64 disabled></textarea>
<br>
<button onclick="copyText()">Copy to Clipboard</button>
