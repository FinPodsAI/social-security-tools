  <p>
    You must earn 40 <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/planners/credits.html">credits</a> to be eligible for for a normal 
    retirement benefit from your own work history.  You can earn a maximum of four credits each year.
    If you have a short work history, you may not be eligible to receive retirement benefits from
    Social Security on your own work history.  You may still be eligible to receive spousal benefits.
