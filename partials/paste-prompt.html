        Login to 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://secure.ssa.gov/RIL/SiView.do">ssa.gov</a>.
        You may need to create an account if you haven't already.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click to navigate to the "Earnings Record" page of the site.
      </li>
      <li>
        Copy the earnings table. It should look similar to the example below,
        with different numbers and years.
        <img src="static/earnings-table-example.png" width=318 height=270>
        You can select the table by dragging your mouse over the entire table to
        select, or you can just use 'Control+A' to select the entire page.
        Either way will work. Copy the text with 'Control+C'.
