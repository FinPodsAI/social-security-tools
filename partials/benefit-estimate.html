   Currently, your total indexed earnings:
    <b>${{taxEngine.totalIndexedEarnings | number}}</b>
  </p>
  </p>
    This is simply the sum of the highest 35 values in the indexed earnings
    column above.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your monthly indexed earnings is calculated as your total indexed earnings
    divided by 35 years divided by 12 months.
    <span ng-if="taxEngine.numEarningsYears() >= 35">
      This is your average indexed earnings in the top 35 years.
    </span>
    <span ng-if="taxEngine.numEarningsYears() < 35">
      If you had 35 years of earnings, this would be your average indexed
      earnings.
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    Monthly indexed earnings:
    <b>${{taxEngine.totalIndexedEarnings | number}}</b> / 35 / 12 =
    <b>${{taxEngine.monthlyIndexedEarnings | number:0}}</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    Your primary insurance amount is based on your monthly indexed earnings 
    using a formula that increases as your earnings increases, but increases
    more slowly for higher total earnings. Your primary insurance amount is
    calculated from your monthly indexed earnings as follows:

    This total

    your primary insurance amount. In the chart below, you can see what your

  <h2>Normal Retirement Age</h2>
  <p>
    Your primary insurance amount of
    <b>${{taxEngine.primaryInsuranceAmountFloored() | number:0}}</b> / month
    is the benefit you will earn if you retire at your
    <u>normal retirement age</u> (NRA). Normal Retirement Age is between 65
    and 67, depending on when you were born.
  </p>

  <p>
    To determine your normal retirement age, as well as learn more about your
    options on when you can begin taking benefits, adjust your birth month and
    year below.

      <u>Quick Note</u>: The multiplier for earnings in the year you turn 60
      (<b>{{taxEngine.dateAtAge(60, 0).year}}</b>) and later years is
      fixed to <b>1.0</b>. When you adjusted your age, this affected
      your calculation of your indexed earnings at the top of the page.
    </p>
  </div>


  <p>
    For those born in <b>{{birth.year}}</b>, normal retirement age is
    <b>{{taxEngine.fullRetirement.ageYears}} years and 
    {{taxEngine.fullRetirement.ageMonths}} months</b>.

    This puts your normal retirement date at
    <b>{{taxEngine.fullRetirementDate.month}}, 
    {{taxEngine.fullRetirementDate.year}}</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you start then, your benefit will be the primary insurance amount,
    rounded down:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>${{taxEngine.primaryInsuranceAmountFloored() | number}}</b> / month
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>${{taxEngine.primaryInsuranceAmountFloored() * 12 | number}}</b>
        / year
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also begin taking benefits as early as 62 years old
    (<b>{{taxEngine.dateAtAge(62, 0).month}}
        {{taxEngine.dateAtAge(62, 0).year}}</b>),
    wait until as late as 70 years old
    (<b>{{taxEngine.dateAtAge(70, 0).month}}
        {{taxEngine.dateAtAge(70, 0).year}}</b>),
    or start anywhere in between. The longer you wait, the higher your
    actual benefit will be.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you choose to take benefits earlier than normal retirement age
    (<b>{{taxEngine.fullRetirementDate.month}} 
        {{taxEngine.fullRetirementDate.year}}</b>),
    your benefit amount will be <u>permanently</u> <i>reduced</i> 
    per year you start early by:
    <ul>
      <li><b>6.67%</b> per year after
        <b>{{taxEngine.fullRetirement.ageYears - 3}} years and 
           {{taxEngine.fullRetirement.ageMonths}} months</b>
        (<b>
           {{taxEngine.dateAtAge(taxEngine.fullRetirement.ageYears - 3, 0).month}}
          {{taxEngine.dateAtAge(taxEngine.fullRetirement.ageYears - 3, 0).year}}
         </b>)
      </li>
      <li><b>5.00%</b> per year before
        <b>{{taxEngine.fullRetirement.ageYears - 3}} years and 
           {{taxEngine.fullRetirement.ageMonths}} months</b>
        (<b>
           {{taxEngine.dateAtAge(taxEngine.fullRetirement.ageYears - 3, 0).month}}
          {{taxEngine.dateAtAge(taxEngine.fullRetirement.ageYears - 3, 0).year}}
         </b>)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p> 
  <p>
    If you choose to instead wait until later than normal retirement age
    (<b>{{taxEngine.fullRetirementDate.month}}
        {{taxEngine.fullRetirementDate.year}}</b>),
     your benefit amount will be <u>permanently</u> <i>increased</i> by
    <b>{{taxEngine.delayIncreaseRate() * 100 | number: 2}}%</b> per year that
    you delay.
  </p>
  <p>
    For a few examples, here's how much your benefit would be at different
    starting ages:

    You can also see this same thing in the interactive chart below, with the
    age you choose to start taking benefits on the x-axis and the annual
    benefit amount on the y-axis. Move your mouse over the chart to watch how
    the earnings change based on the age that you first start taking benefits.
