  <h2>Normal Retirement Age</h2>
  <p>
    Your primary insurance amount of
    <b>${{taxEngine.primaryInsuranceAmountFloored() | number:0}}</b> / month
    is the benefit you will earn if you retire at your
    <u>normal retirement age</u> (NRA). Normal Retirement Age is between 65
    and 67, depending on when you were born.
  </p>

  <p>
    For those born in <b>{{birth.year}}</b>, normal retirement age is
    <b>{{taxEngine.fullRetirement.ageYears}} years and 
    {{taxEngine.fullRetirement.ageMonths}} months</b>.

    This puts your normal retirement date at
    <b>{{taxEngine.fullRetirementDate.month}}, 
    {{taxEngine.fullRetirementDate.year}}</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you start collecting benefits then, your benefit will be the primary
    insurance amount, rounded down:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>${{taxEngine.primaryInsuranceAmountFloored() | number}}</b> / month
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>${{taxEngine.primaryInsuranceAmountFloored() * 12 | number}}</b>
        / year
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Early and Delayed Retirement</h2>
  <p>
    You can also begin taking benefits as early as 62 years old
    (<b>{{taxEngine.dateAtAge(62, 0).month}}
        {{taxEngine.dateAtAge(62, 0).year}}</b>),
    wait until as late as 70 years old
    (<b>{{taxEngine.dateAtAge(70, 0).month}}
        {{taxEngine.dateAtAge(70, 0).year}}</b>),
    or start any month in between. The longer you wait, the higher your
    actual benefit will be.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you choose to take benefits earlier than normal retirement age
    (<b>{{taxEngine.fullRetirementDate.month}} 
        {{taxEngine.fullRetirementDate.year}}</b>),
    your benefit amount will be <u>permanently</u> <i>reduced</i> 
    per year you start early by:
    <ul>
      <li><b>6.67%</b> per year after
        <b>{{taxEngine.fullRetirement.ageYears - 3}} years and 
           {{taxEngine.fullRetirement.ageMonths}} months</b>
        (<b>
           {{taxEngine.dateAtAge(taxEngine.fullRetirement.ageYears - 3, 0).month}}
          {{taxEngine.dateAtAge(taxEngine.fullRetirement.ageYears - 3, 0).year}}
         </b>)
      </li>
      <li><b>5.00%</b> per year before
        <b>{{taxEngine.fullRetirement.ageYears - 3}} years and 
           {{taxEngine.fullRetirement.ageMonths}} months</b>
        (<b>
           {{taxEngine.dateAtAge(taxEngine.fullRetirement.ageYears - 3, 0).month}}
          {{taxEngine.dateAtAge(taxEngine.fullRetirement.ageYears - 3, 0).year}}
         </b>)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p> 
  <p>
    If you choose to instead wait until later than normal retirement age
    (<b>{{taxEngine.fullRetirementDate.month}}
        {{taxEngine.fullRetirementDate.year}}</b>),
     your benefit amount will be <u>permanently</u> <i>increased</i> by
    <b>{{taxEngine.delayIncreaseRate() * 100 | number: 2}}%</b> per year that
    you delay.
  </p>
  <p>
    For a few examples, here's how much your benefit would be at different
    starting ages:

        <td headers="adjustment">

        </td>
        <td headers="monthlybenefit">
          ${{taxEngine.benefitAtAge(age, 0) | number:0}}
        </td>
        <td headers="annualbenefit">
          ${{taxEngine.benefitAtAge(age, 0) * 12 | number:0}}
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

    You can also see this same thing in the interactive chart below, with the
    age you choose to start taking benefits on the x-axis and the annual
    benefit amount on the y-axis. Move your mouse over the chart to watch how
    the earnings change based on the age that you first start taking benefits.
