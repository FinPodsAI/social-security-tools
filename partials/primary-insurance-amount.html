  <h2>Primary Insurance Amount</h2>
  <p>
    We first compute your <u>primary insurance amount</u> (PIA). This is the
    dollar amount that Social Security will pay you every year at your
    <u>normal retirement age</u> (NRA).
  </p>

  <p>
    Don't let the goverment-mandated acronyms confuse you. Think of the primary
    insurance amount like a salary: it's the amount of money you can expect to
    earn in retirement every year starting at your normal retirement age. Your
    normal retirement age is between 65 and 67, depending on what year you were
    born. We'll look at normal retirement age in more detail later in this
    report.
  </p>

  <p>
    You have social security earnings recorded for
    <b>{{taxEngine.numEarningsYears()}}</b> total years.
  </p>

  <p ng-if="taxEngine.numEarningsYears() >= 35">
    Only the top 35 years of <u>indexed earnings</u> values will be used in
    the calculation of your primary insurance amount. Indexed earnings
    are simply the payroll wages you earned in a year multiplied by
    a number that adjusts for wage growth (similar to adjusting for inflation).
    In your case, this means that years where the indexed earnings value
    falls below <b>${{taxEngine.cutoffIndexedEarnings | number}}</b> do not
    affect your benefit calculation. If you were to earn additional years of
    wages in the future, they would only affect your social security if you
    earned more than <b>${{taxEngine.cutoffIndexedEarnings | number}}</b> in
    a year.
  </p>

  <p ng-if="taxEngine.numEarningsYears() < 35">
    The top 35 <u>indexed earnings</u> values will be used in the calculation of
    your primary insurance amount. Indexed earnings are simply the payroll
    wages you earned in a year multiplied by a number that adjusts for
    wage growth. As you don't have 35 years of earnings yet, every additional
    year you work will increase your benefit a little more. Once you reach 35
    years of earnings values, increasing your primary insurance amount requires
    earning more than previous years' indexed values.
  </p>
  
  <p ng-if="!taxEngine.isOver60()">
    The multipliers in the above table will increase every year until you
    attain age 60. The increase is determined by US wage growth. Your 
    <u>indexed earnings</u> in a year will always be equivalent to modern
    wages.
  </p>

  <p>
   Currently, your total indexed earnings:
    <b>${{taxEngine.totalIndexedEarnings | number:0}}</b>
  </p>

  </p>
    This is simply the sum of the highest 35 values in the indexed earnings
    column above.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your monthly indexed earnings is calculated as your total indexed earnings
    divided by 35 years divided by 12 months.
    <span ng-if="taxEngine.numEarningsYears() >= 35">
      This is your monthly average indexed earnings in the top 35 years.
    </span>
    <span ng-if="taxEngine.numEarningsYears() < 35">
      If you had 35 years of earnings, this would be your monthly average
      indexed earnings.
    </span>
  </p>

  <p>
    Monthly average indexed earnings:
    <b>${{taxEngine.totalIndexedEarnings | number}}</b> / 35 / 12 =
    <b>${{taxEngine.monthlyIndexedEarnings | number:0}}</b>
  </p>

  <p>
    Your primary insurance amount is based on your monthly indexed earnings 
    using a formula that increases as your earnings increases, but increases
    more slowly for higher total earnings. Your primary insurance amount is
    calculated from your monthly indexed earnings as follows:

  <div ng-if="taxEngine.shouldAdjustForCOLA()">
    <p>
      After attaining age 62, your primary insurance amount will increase
      annually in proportion to the consumer price index, a measure of
      inflation. This will continue every year, even after beginning
      to collect your benefit. These adjustments are called 
      <u>Cost of Living Adjustments</u> (COLA). Below we show you the
      adjustments in past years affecting your current primary insurance
      amount.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li ng-repeat="adjustment in taxEngine.colaAdjustments() | orderBy : adjustment.year">
        {{adjustment.year}}: <b>{{adjustment.start | number:2}}</b>

    This total
    (<b>${{taxEngine.primaryInsuranceAmount() | number:2}}</b> / month) is
    your primary insurance amount. In the chart below, you can see what your
    primary insurance amount would be if your indexed earnings were to
    increase. Move your mouse over the chart to watch how the primary insurance
    amount changes.
