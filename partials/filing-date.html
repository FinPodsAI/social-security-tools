  <h2>Deciding what age to start benefits</h2>

  <p>
    As you can see, an important decision available to you is what date should
    you select to begin your Social Security benefits. The above charts display
    the consequences of each choice. By delaying, you will not receive benefits
    as early, but will receive a higher benefit when you start later in life.
  </p>
  <h3>What do most Americans do?</h3>
  <p>
    According to a 2015 report by the Center for Retirement Research at
    Boston College,
    <a href="http://crr.bc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IB_15-8.pdf"
    target="_blank">Trends in Social Security Claiming</a>:
  </p>
  <p>The most popular age to start benefits is as early as possible: 62</p>
  <ul>
    <li>42% of men start benefits at age 62</li>
    <li>48% of women start benefits at age 62</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The next most popular age to start benefits is at Normal Retirement Age:
    65-66
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>34% of men start benefits at Normal Retirement Age</li>
    <li>27% of women start benefits at Normal Retirement Age</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The trend is towards starting benefits later in life. In the last 25 years,
    the number of people claiming benefits at 62 has been dropping.
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>16.6% fewer men claiming at 62</li>
    <li> 8.2% fewer women claiming at 62</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Reasons to start early</h3>
  <p>
    One consideration might be your health at the time of retirement. If you
    are unlikely to earn many years of social security benefits, you may want
    to choose to begin benefits sooner.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another reason is personal necessity. For many, retirement savings is
    insufficient preparation for the the demands of living without a paycheck.
    Early social security benefits can assist with that burden.
  </p>
  <h3>Reasons to delay</h3>
  <p>
    Typically retirees have to worry more about finances the longer they live.
    Spending down savings over longer numbers of years increases the chance
    of running out. Delaying Social Security benefits can be seen as insurance
    against the financial risk of living a long life. This is sometimes
    compared to an annuity.
  </p>
  <p>
    The value of the Survivor Benefit may be something to consider when
    choosing initial benefit dates for both spouses, but especially
    <span class=names>{{higherEarner().name}}</span>. Delaying current
    benefits can have an effect similar to life insurance by providing a higher
    Survivor Benefit.
  </p>
  <h3>Optimization</h3>
  <p>
    The lifetime optimized value of different choices depends on the one input
    that nobody can know: age of death for you and your spouse. Online
    services exist which will calculate the optimal strategy. They all must
    make some assumptions about your expected lifespan to work.
  </p>
  <p>
    The optimal strategy may not be what returns the highest payments. For
    some, it is optimal to have higher income during their early years of
    retirement. For others, it's optimal to protect against running out of
    money while living a long healthy life.
  </p>
  <p>
    SocialSecurity.Tools does not provide a mathmatical optimizer feature
    currently, but does recommend the calculator at 
    <a href="https://opensocialsecurity.com/" target=_blank
      >Open Social Security</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can enter your estimated Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) into Open
    Social Security to get a recommended filing strategy. This calculator
    weighs options by year using Mortality tables. It also accounts for a
    discount rate of money, valuing money now as more valuable than money
    later.
